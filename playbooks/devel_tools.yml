  #     content: |
  #       You can find spacemacs downloaded from github in /opt/spacemacs/emacs.d
  #       To use it, you probably want to do something like this:
  #       ```
  #       cp -a /opt/spacemacs/emacs.d ~/.emacs.d
  #       ```
  # This seems not to really work, since on startup of spacemacs it wants to update/download a bunch of packages...
  # It's possible to mirror the pacakges and stuff(see https://github.com/d12frosted/elpa-mirror), but it's around 1.1GiB
  # Probably best to implement some kind of trusted mirror site and allow teams access to that(also for docs)
